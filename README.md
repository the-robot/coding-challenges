#### Problem 09
> by `Airbnb`    

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers.
Numbers can be 0 or negative.

For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6 and 5.
[5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) times and constant space?

#### Problem 27
> by `Facebook`

Given a string of round, curly and square open and closing brackets,
return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the strign "([])[]({})", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.
