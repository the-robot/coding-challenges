[14 Patterns to Ace Any Coding Interview Question](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed)

<br/>

### [01. Sliding Window](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/leet-code/educative.io/01-sliding-window)
- The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array, or string
- You're asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

### [02. Two Pointers](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/leet-code/educative.io/02-two-pointers)
- It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
- The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

### [03. Fast and Slow Pointers](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/leet-code/educative.io/03-fast-and-slow-pointers)
- The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list, array (i.e. finding a cycle in the array) or sometimes a single number `(Happy Number problem)`
- When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.

### [04. Merge Intervals](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/leet-code/educative.io/04-merge-intervals)
- If you’re asked to produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
- If you hear the term “overlapping intervals”.

### [05. Cyclic Sort](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/leet-code/educative.io/05-cyclic-sort)
- They will be problems involving a sorted array with numbers in a given range.
- If the problem asks you to find the missing/duplicate/smallest number in an sorted/rotated array.
