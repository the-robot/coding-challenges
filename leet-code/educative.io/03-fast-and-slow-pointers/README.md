Useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or array.

**Ways to identify when to use the Fast and Slow pattern:**

- The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array
- When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.


> When should I use it over the Two Pointer method mentioned above?  
> 
> There are some cases where you shouldn’t use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you can’t move in a backwards direction. An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when you’re trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.  

Problems featuring the fast and slow pointers pattern:  
- Linked List Cycle (easy)
- Palindrome Linked List (medium)
- Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)
