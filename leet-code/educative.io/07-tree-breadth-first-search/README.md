Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using breadth first search.

**How to identify the Tree BFS pattern:** 

- If youâ€™re asked to traverse a tree in a level-by-level fashion (or level order traversal).

Problems featuring Tree BFS pattern:  
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (easy)
- Zigzag Traversal (medium)
