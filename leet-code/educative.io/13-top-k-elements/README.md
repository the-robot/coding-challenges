**How to identify the pattern:**  
- Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent "K" elements among a given set falls under this pattern.

The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of "K" elements is Heap.  
This pattern will make use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with "K" elements at a time from a set of given elements.
