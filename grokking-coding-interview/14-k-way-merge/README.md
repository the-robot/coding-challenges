The pattern looks like this:  
- Insert the first element of each array in a Min Heap.
- After this, take out the smallest (top) element from the heap and add it to the merged list.
- After removing the smallest element from the heap, insert the next element of the same list into the heap.
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 to populate the merged list in sorted order.

**How to identify the K-way Merge pattern:**  
- The problem will feature sorted arrays, lists, or a matrix.
- If the problem asks you to merge sorted lists, find the smallest element in a sorted list.

Problems featuring the K-way Merge pattern:
- Merge K Sorted Lists (medium)
- K Pairs with Largest Sums (Hard)
