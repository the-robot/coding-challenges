### [01. Sliding Window](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/01-sliding-window)
- The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array, or string
- You're asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

### [02. Two Pointers](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/02-two-pointers)
- It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
- The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

### [03. Fast and Slow Pointers](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/03-fast-and-slow-pointers)
- The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list, array (i.e. finding a cycle in the array) or sometimes a single number `(Happy Number problem)`
- When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.

### [04. Merge Intervals](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/04-merge-intervals)
- If you’re asked to produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
- If you hear the term “overlapping intervals”.

### [05. Cyclic Sort](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/05-cyclic-sort)
- They will be problems involving a sorted array with numbers in a given range.
- If the problem asks you to find the missing/duplicate/smallest number in an sorted/rotated array.

### [06. In Place Reversal of a LinkedList](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/06-in-place-reversal-of-a-linkedlist)
- If you’re asked to reverse a linked list without using extra memory.

### [07. Tree Breadth First Search](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/07-tree-breadth-first-search)
- If you’re asked to traverse a tree in a level-by-level fashion (or level order traversal).

### [08. Tree Depth First Search](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/08-tree-depth-first-search)
- If you’re asked to traverse a tree with in-order, preorder, or postorder DFS.
- If the problem requires searching for something where the node is closer to a leaf.

### [09. Two Heaps](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/09-two-heaps)
- Useful in situations like Priority Queue, Scheduling
- If the problem states that you need to find the smallest/largest/median elements of a set
- Sometimes, useful in problems featuring a binary tree data structure

### [10. Subsets](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/10-subsets)
- Problems where you need to find the combinations or permutations of a given set

### [11. Modified Binary Search](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/11-modified-binary-search)
- Whenever you are given a sorted array, linked list, or matrix, and are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm you can use is the Binary Search.
- This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving Binary Search.

### [12. Bitwise XOR](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/12-bitwise-xor)

### [13. Top K Elements](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/13-top-k-elements)
- Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent "K" elements among a given set falls under this pattern.
- The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of "K" elements is Heap.  

### [14. K-way merge](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/14-k-way-merge)
- The problem will feature sorted arrays, lists, or a matrix.
- If the problem asks you to merge sorted lists, find the smallest element in a sorted list.

### [15. 0 or 1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/15-0-or-1-kanpsack-dynamic-programming)
- the overlapping subproblems

### [16.Topological Sort (Graph)](https://github.com/the-robot/coding-challenges/tree/master/grokking-coding-interview/16-topological-sort)
- the problem will deal with graphs that have no directed cycles
- if you’re asked to update all objects in a sorted order
- if you have a class of objects that follow a particular order
