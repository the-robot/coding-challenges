Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event "B" is dependent on event "A", "A" comes before "B" in topological ordering.

**How to identify the topological sort pattern:**  
- the problem will deal with graphs that have no directed cycles
- if youâ€™re asked to update all objects in a sorted order
- if you have a class of objects that follow a particular order
