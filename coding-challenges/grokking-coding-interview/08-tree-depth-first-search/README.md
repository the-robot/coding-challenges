You can use recursion (or a stack for the iterative approach) to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing.

**How to identify the Tree DFS pattern:** 

- If youâ€™re asked to traverse a tree with in-order, preorder, or postorder DFS.
- If the problem requires searching for something where the node is closer to a leaf.

Problems featuring Tree DFS pattern:  
- Sum of Path Numbers (medium)
- All Paths for a Sum (medium)
