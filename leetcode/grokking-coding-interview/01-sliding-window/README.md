**Following are some ways you can identify that the given problem might require a sliding window:**

- The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array, or string
- You're asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

Common problems you use the sliding window pattern with:
- Maximum sum subarray of size `K` (easy)
- Longest substring with `K` distinct characters (medium)
- String anagrams (hard)
