A huge number of coding interview problems involve dealing with Permutations and Combinations of a given set of elements. The pattern Subsets describes an efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) approach to handle all these problems.  

**How to identify the Subsets pattern:**  
- Problems where you need to find the combinations or permutations of a given set.


Problems featuring Subsets pattern:
- Subsets With Duplicates (easy)
- String Permutations by changing case (medium)
